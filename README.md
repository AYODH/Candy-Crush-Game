# Candy Crush Game

## Description
This is a web-based implementation of the popular puzzle game Candy Crush. Players swap adjacent candies on a grid to form rows or columns of three or more matching candies, which are then removed from the board. New candies drop from the top to fill the empty spaces, potentially creating a chain reaction of matching candies.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid**: A 9x9 grid filled with colorful candy images.
- **Drag and Drop**: Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for swapping candies.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score as they make matches.
- **Animated Candy Movement**: Candies slide down to fill empty spaces, and new candies are generated.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.htm` file in your web browser.
2. The game board will be displayed with randomly placed candies.
3. Click and drag a candy to swap it with an adjacent candy.
4. Form a row or column of three or more matching candies to crush them and earn points.
5. The game continues indefinitely, with new candies appearing to replace those that were crushed.
